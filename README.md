# TimeTable Game

## What features does it have?
This is a game where you have a minute to answer as many timetable questions as you can.

You have an option to select which timetables you want to appear.

At the end of the game, you can see how many questions you got right and wrong, and a graph which shows how many questions you have answered each second also appears.

## How was it made?
This game is made using **Svelte** and **SvelteKit**, so it uses **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.

It is hosted by **Netlify**.

## How did you get the idea of making this?
Since I first played TTRockstars, I've always wanted to make a game like this.

So when I started learning Svelte and needed a project idea, I decided to make this.

## Where can I play it?
You can play the game [here](https://timetable-game.netlify.app).

Or you can clone this repository, and run npm run dev to play it locally.
